description:
  - When building installations we should opt for materials that are made sustainably and that fit the lifecycle of the project. These materials range from sustainable versions of go-to construction materials like MDF and plywood to recycled, innovative or even storytelling materials made from unexpected resources, like mycelium or surfaces made from coffee grinds.
actions:
  - Optimise material usage for project duration – use higher grade, bespoke material options for longer-term projects
  - Consider renting when working with electronics for temporary use
  - Build modular so individual materials can be reused
  - Prefer ethically made, non-toxic materials (FSC/PEFC)
  - Optimise material usage for project duration; bio-degradable material for temporary installs
  - Source local production partners in order to reduce transport footprint
  - Establish local library of sustainable materials for reference and inspiration
  - Seek suppliers and partners who apply sustainable practices themselves
