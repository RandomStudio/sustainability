description:
  - When working with a project that will be running elsewhere, the source of energy is often out of our hands. Finding ways to reduce energy usage is where we can make a real difference. For example opting for less energy intensive electronics (if available), using natural sources like sunlight, or having the project shut down whenever it’s not in use.
actions:
  - Consider a scheduled sleep-mode when the project is not in use
  - Opt for renewable electricity derived from natural sources
  - Use energy efficiency as criteria when selecting equipment
  - Align with client on balance between sustainability and the need for visual impact
  - Calculate and evaluate real-world energy consumption of our projects
