  - When we measure the steps that we take, mapping where we have opted for a sustainable choice, we can summarise what we have achieved at the end of the project in the form of a report. This is to help our client and ourselves to better understand where we have made a difference, and where we can still improve in the future.
actions:
  - External + internal sustainability report
  - Document sustainable choices made throughout
  - Include sustainability in end of project review
