# Check the impact of the material choices against a database

Sometimes the ecological impact of a certain material is not straightforward. A material you might perceive as sustainable, might have more impact than another material. For example, fleece fabric (which is recycled PET bottles) has more impact than regular cotton, simply because of the energy it costs to process the bottles. 

To find out whether the material you have opted for is the best choice for the concept, there are quick ways to roughly estimate this. For this we use a database of CO2eq impacts from Impact Forecast, which indicates how much CO2 is emitted per kilogram of material.
