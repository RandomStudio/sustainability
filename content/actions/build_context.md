# Consider material sustainability in the context of its application

There is no 'bad' material in their own sense. The flow of materials in the system matters more for the overall sustainability of a project. How the material is applied within the project, how it's used, what the end of life process is. If the focus is only on matererial properties, we fail to see the full picture of the issue, and we will not be able to effectively achieve sustainable change. 

One example is plexiglass. This material is extremely lightweight, and not prone to breaking. If it's applied in a modular system where it will be used over and over again for a very long periof of time, and landfill is avoided, the material is not less sustainable than glass. 

So our work is to make it possible to design for the full life of the project, as that can bring about real systemic change.
