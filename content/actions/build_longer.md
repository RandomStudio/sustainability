# Use higher grade, bespoke material options only for longer duration projects

When an installation or project will be running for a long period of time (ie. a year or longer) opt for high grade materials that will be able to withstand that period without losing their function. 

For permanent installations, bespoke material options are also a good choice, as long as they can be maintained and the parts can be individually repaired/replaced so that good material is not wasted.

Still, for projects that last a year or so, material like metal or wood will still be there when the installation will be taken down, so it's vital there is a good recycling process in place as well.
