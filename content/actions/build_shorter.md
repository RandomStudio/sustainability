# For temporary/short-term projects, perfer natural/biodegradable material

When a project is only up for a couple of weeks, it's interesting to look at materials that are fully biodegradable. These materials can be easily turned back into resources for the natural world, and do not require costly recycling or remanufacturing processes. 

Often, these materials also bring an interesting story along with them, such as materials fully made from funghi. The use of these in our projects also further advances the circular economy.
