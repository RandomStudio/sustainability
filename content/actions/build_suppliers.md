# Seek suppliers and partners who apply sustainable practises themselves

In most cases, we will not be the ones actually manufacturing our builds. To ensure a sustainable build, the first step is partnering with a manufacturer who has good sustainability practises in place. 

The more design decisions we take prior to manufacture, the more we can guide the build in a sustainable direction. Will it be modular, how are the joints connected? Does it have to be fit for repair? What type of material are we opting for?

What really makes a difference in terms of supplier is their policies regarding reuse and recycling. Does the production partner take back the material, will it store them and reuse them later? The origin of materials and whether they were ethically sourced is also worth checking out. Making choices here is not always possible, but that does not mean we can't inquire.
