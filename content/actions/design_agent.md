# Consider yourself as an agent of change in the transition to a sustainable world

Sustainability touches every part of the process, but the desiger has a unique role. The options to make sustainable changes to the project are most abundant in the design phase, thus giving the designer broader opportunities (and responsibilities!) to make change. 

A change agent can be defined as someone who who doesnâ€™t accept the status quo that things are impossible to change for the better. Ask how things might be different, more sustainable, more ethical, putting the attention on the issue of sustainability and impact gets the ball rolling for others as well.
