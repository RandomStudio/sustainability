# Approach the design process from a circular perspective

### 7 Principles of Circular design:

1. **Start with the functionality**
    
    Reverse engineering after the fact has limited effects, so focus on the primary functional delivery, what does the design have to convey? This is an opportunity to break cognitive frames that fall back on unsustainable sustainable. 
    
2. **Look across the entire life**
    
    How the design will exist in the world is defined in the concept phase. Will it be taken down quickly, or is it an installation with a longer lifetime? Identifying the projects' life cycle provides a better overview, and gives you the opportunity to make more informed decisions on the required resources.
    
3. **Think in systems**
    
    Essentially, everything is reliant upon something else for survival. From this idea, you can shift the way you see the world, from a linear, structured worldview to a dynamic, chaotic, interconnected array of relationships and feedback loops.
    
4. **Design for systems change**
    
    How do your choices impact other systems? Is there a better way for materials to flow so our waste becomes a nutrient for someone else? Looking at the cause and effect relationships of your choices helps you see the changes that are possible. 
    
5. **Embrace the complexity**
    
    Work with the complexity of the situation. Material sustainability always depends on how it is used in the project. There is no black and white, good or bad. A previous sustainable solution might not work in another. Understanding these contexts helps you make better decisions that can benefit the sustainability of the project. 
    
6. **Get to grips with systems dynamics**
    
    Good intentions don't always lead to good outcomes, a circular designer is constantly questioning the effects of actions as much as thinking about the viability of what they are creating to bring about the desired effect.
    
7. **Take full reponsibility**
    
    Without full life-cycle responsibility, we are limited in the sustainable interventions we can take. Integrating the full life-cycle, from creation to end-of-life, into the design and the business case increases the chance we can make real systemic change.
