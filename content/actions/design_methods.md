# Explore sustainable design methods while ideating during the concept phase

### 8 Sustainable Design Methods to consider:

1. **Modularity**
    
    Modular design is design that can adapt to different spaces and scenarios. Making individual elements durable enough and compatible to many configurations increases longevity. Standardising the pieces also increases the ability to recyle the product properly, as well as repair it.
    
    <details><summary>Questions to ask yourself while designing modular:</summary><br>
        - What functions do the different parts have? <br>
        - Can components with a longer lifespan than the project later be reused in a new system? <br>
        - Are there as little permanent joints as possible? <br>
    </details>

2. **Disassembly**
    
    Design for disasembly is making sure everything can be easily taken apart. This makes each component fit for reuse or easy recycling. With this method, pay attention to the connection mechanisms, the amount of different materials used, the way it's put together and the ease of extraction.  
    
    <details><summary>Questions to ask yourself while designing for disassembly:</summary><br>
        - Are all parts completely removable? <br>
        - Is reusability being limited by the joint? <br>
        - Are the parts that need replacement most often recyclable and able to be removed without damaging the rest? <br>
        - Can the parts be used more than once? <br>
        - Are all the parts easily recyclable? <br>
    </details>
       
3. **Dematerialisation**
    
    Design for dematerialisation is all about using less, and fewer types of materials. Here, it's about finding the sweet spot: using only the essential amount of materials, but not dematerialise too far so that the longevity of the project is negatively affected.
    <details><summary>Questions to ask yourself while designing for dematerialisation:</summary><br>
        - Can the use of resources be reduced without loss of function? <br>
        - How many types of resources does the project use? <br>
    </details>

4. **Longevity**
    
    Design for longevity ensures the project or it's components retain their value over time. Choosing higher quality materials with less chance for degradation increases the lifespan, but  also affects whether it will be repaired rather than discarded. It decreases the need for new items to be made. 
    <details><summary>Questions to ask yourself while designing for longevity:</summary><br>
        - Are individual materials fit to last the desired lifespan? <br>
        - If a material needs replacement, can it be taken out and recycled properly? <br>
        - Can components with a longer lifespan than the project later be used elsewhere? <br>
    </details>
  
5. **Recyclability**
    
    Designing for recyclability means selecting the right materials, as well as paying attention to disassembly. Bear in mind that even when a project is designed to be recycled, it does not mean it will be. Designing in a recycling system, for example a take-back approach, will enable this. Furthermore, enabling materials to be recycled further reduced the need for raw materials to be extracted. 
    <details><summary>Questions to ask yourself while designing for recyclability:</summary><br>
        - Is the material you are using a mix of different resources? (like plastic fused to cardboard) This means it's costlier to recycle. <br>
        - Can the materials be extracted from the project without damage? <br>
        - Is there a plan in place to ensure recycling? <br>
    </details>
 
6. **Repairability**
    
    Designing for repairability is closely related to modular design and design for disassembly. The focus however is on parts that might have a shorter lifespan than the duration of the project, and ensuring they are easily accessible for repair and replacement.
    <details><summary>Questions to ask yourself while designing for repairability:</summary><br>
        - Are the parts that need replacement most often recyclable and able to be removed without damaging the rest? <br>
        - Are the parts that are in use able to be accessed and removed easily? <br>
        - Who is responsible for the repair? <br>
        - Are there different materials available that decrease the need for maintanance? <br>
  </details>
  
7. **Reusability**
    
    Designing for reusability means that after the initial install, the parts of the project can be reused in a different way. This also creates longevity. The best way to ensure reusability is designing the project within a system (like leasing) or creating a scenario for the second life in advance. 
    <details><summary>Questions to ask yourself while designing for reusability:</summary><br>
        - Is the design fit for different scenarios, locations or configurations? <br>
        - Are the materials still of good quality after the initial install? <br>
        - Is there a possibility for leasing to take full product stewardship and ensure reuse? <br>
  </details>
  
8. **Remanufacture**
    
    Designing for remanufacture is another way to close the system. How can parts of the project be remanufacuted for further use, and what is needed to make it happen? Disassembly plays an important part in this as well, ensuring there is as little loss of value as possible in order to make it viable for remanufacture. 
    <details><summary>Questions to ask yourself while designing for remanufacture:</summary><br>
        - What other functions can the component have outside the project? <br>
        - Is disassembly being limited by the material connections? <br>
        - What needs to be done to make remanufacture possible? <br>
