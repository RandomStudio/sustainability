# Apply nature-based design concepts

**Biophilic Design**

Nature based design, like biophilic design, means incorporating and supporting functioning ecosystems into (primarily) architectural spaces. Through incorporating nature into buildings, it  reconnects people to the natural environment and fosters a larger emotional connection to the space. 

Buildings that apply nature based design are dynamic and can easily shift in function or form. This ecosystem mindset will enable buildings and workplace practices to be regenerative, offering back more from the system than they take.

**Biomimicry**

There is also nature inspired design, or biomimicry. This is modelled from nature, and applies natures solutions to human design problems. It does not have to exist within an ecosystem, or be sustainably made. 

**3 Essential Elements of Biomimicry:** <br>
    1. **Emulate:** learning from and then replicating nature’s forms, processes, and ecosystems to create more regenerative designs. <br>
    2. **Ethos:** understanding how life works and creating designs that continuously support and create conditions conducive to life. <br>
    3. **(Re)Connect:** we are nature and find value in connecting to our place on Earth as part of life’s interconnected systems. Observe and spend time in nature to understand how life works so that we may have a better ethos to emulate biological strategies in our designs. <br>
