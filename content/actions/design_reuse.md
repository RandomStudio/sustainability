# Look for opportunities to incorporate existing materials and equipment in concepts

Could the design or feature be adapted slightly to allow for reuse? As mentioned in the Discovery phase, the reuse of material often leads to a significant drop in ecological impact, and it's a great way to keep material costs limited at the same time. 

Browse available assets from the client or ourselves, and critically look at if these materials could be utilised. Especially concerning hardware. Bear in mind the materials longevity, it's previous uses, and location. Existing materials that are located very remote might be be less sustainable due to transport emissions. As a general rule, avoid having to ship from outside of Europe.  

It might require some additional logistics, so incorporating this material early in the project process prevents surprises later on.
