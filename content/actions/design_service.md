# Consider integrating a Product Service System into the design

Circular design relies on systems that support this. Applying Product Service Systems enables us to move from a linear process, creating waste and other externalities, to a circular one. One example of this is renting or leasing our projects, to ensure we are in charge of end-of-life management.

Other questions you can ask youself are: 

- What are the social and system-wide implications of what you are designing?
- What types of unintended consequences could this project have on the different systems?
- How can the design have a positive effect through a feedback loop so it continues to give value?
- Can you design out waste rom the project through changing how it's delivered?
- How can you make sure the value of the different parts is maintained even when it is no longer in operation?
