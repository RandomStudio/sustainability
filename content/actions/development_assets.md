# Be mindful of using (extremely) large amounts of digital assets

Ensure that all your images have a justifiable purpose. The more (high quality) assets are required, the more data transer and storage is neccesary. Try to consider the impact this has. Globally, 3.7% of the total emissions stem from data centers and website traffic. Images and video files are the biggest contributers to the impact of a website, so minimising these assets and only loading essential content can save a lot.
