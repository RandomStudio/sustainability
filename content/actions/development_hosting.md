# Choose hosting solutions powered by renewable energy wherever possible

A sustainable hosting provider is a relatively easy accessible option. There are already a lot of different options available, from different renewable energy sources to mixes. Not all renewable energy is created equal, so it's important to make an informed choice. For example, is the provider using sustainable energy credits, or powered directly by renewable energy? 

For our studio we have partnered with leaf.cloud, a decentralised hosting provider that re-uses energy to heat water in large hotel and appartment buildings. Their servers are not concentrated in one spot, but rather spread out over Amsterdam.
