# Always utilize the best possible image compression

Reducing the file size of the images we use on web interfaces is one of the most straightforward way to reduct a website's impact. Things to consider here are the purpose of the image, does it need to be very detailed for it so serve it's purpose? Perhaps it could be compressed in a visual way. Is an image neccesary at all or could it also be an SVG graphic?
