# Load content by request, not by default

Consider implementing meaures to load content dynamically, for example as you scroll down or as you explore the 3D environment. This way only the essential amount of content is being processed by the server. Also consider this measure for video content: load and play videos only when the user clicks or otherwise requests to play the video.
