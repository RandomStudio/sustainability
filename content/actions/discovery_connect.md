# Connect with potential local partners

When looking for a supplier or production partner that is going to manufacture or assemble the physical parts of our project, always consider their location to the project site. Weight equals impact, this also goes for emissions associated with transport. 

Try to avoid any type of air freight, and check out possibilities for electric vehicles or trains to transport our equipment.
