# Include sustainability explicitly as part of the project kick-off process

The sooner sustainability is brought into view in the project process, the more positive impact we can make. To ensure this, we always include the topic in our project kick-off canvas. With this, teams can already ideate on the way sustainability can be part of the project, and think of the lasting (ecological and social) impacts the project could have on our stakeholders, both positive and negative.

As 80% of the ecological impact of a project is locked in in the concept and design phase, so considering sustainability in this phase is vital to the overall sustainability of our projects.
