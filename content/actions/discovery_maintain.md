# Maintain an accurate listing of studio-owned equipment

If we keep track of the equipment we have in our studio we are more likely to (re)use, which leads to a significantly smaller environmental impact. Prolonging the lifespan of equipment through reuse is one of the easiest sustainable solutions. 

When considering to purchase new equipment, consider what the likelihood of reusing that equipment is in future projects. If it's unlikely we will need it again in the future, can it be rented or borrowed somewhere instead?
