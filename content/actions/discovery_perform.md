# Perform a client asset and resource audit

By far the most sustainable option to sourcing materials is using what is already there. The extraction and manufacturing of materials are large contributors to the impact of a material, and material scarcity is also a pressing issue. Assessing what the client or their production partner have in house, and using this in the design is very valuable in the ecological sense, plus it could be cheaper too.

A material such as wood or aluminium twice has about 70% less environmental impact if it's used twice as opposed to once.
