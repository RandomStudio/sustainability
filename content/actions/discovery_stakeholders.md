# Consider the effects of the project on different stakeholders

In order to understand the full impact of our work on all stakeholders, it's important to develop a diverse perspective of the situation the project exists in. Which parties are impacted (positively or negatively) by our decisions, and in what way? 

**Human Stakeholders:**

- Random's Employees
- The local community at the site of the project
- Employees of our suppliers

**Planet Centric Stakeholders:** 

- Natural ecosystems
- Animal and Plant life

**A rights-based stakeholders approach:** 

Learning from nature, applying nature-based solutions or collaborating with nature. Investing in the development of frameworks that protect the legal rights of nature ensures these non-human stakeholders are better protected in the future. 

**Resources:** 

- Read [Nature as a resource, what does that mean and what are the benefits?](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/why-nature-will-be-the-most-important-stakeholder-in-the-coming-decade/)
- Look into our studio's [Materiality Assessment](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lAuvL_Q=/) to what stakeholder effects we track
