# Understand the different systems that interact with our work

Our world is made up of systems. Globally, we regognise three large systems:

1. The **social** system, there to maintain social order. 
2. The **industrial** system, created to sustain human needs. 
3. The **ecological** system, there to maintain all life on earth

Systems thinking means looking at these systems as interconnected, and understanding what the effects of our work are on these three systems and all their components, helps us make more responsible choices that do not have unintended consequences. Understanding and implementing this takes time, and is complex. If you are interested in how it can work, make sure to check out the below resources.
