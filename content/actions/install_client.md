# Align with client on balance between sustainability and the need for visual impact

When working with primarily digital media and electronic equipment, less is most of the time more sustainable. There are always trade-offs to be made when considering the ecological impact of our projects, as well as the experiential impact we want to have. 

Could there be a solution that uses less energy consuming equipment, or perhaps an analog medium? These trade-offs are interesting to discuss with the client, they might be subversive at first but in the transition to a sustianable industry these type of conversations need to happen.
