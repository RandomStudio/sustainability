# Estimate and then evaluate the energy consumption of our projects

In order for us to put together a sustainability summary at the end of every project, it's helpful if we have an indication of our energy consumption, especially if we have made decisions earlier on to opt for more energy efficient equipment. How much of a difference did those make? If we have this information for future projects we can make better, more informed, decisions in terms of our hardware.
