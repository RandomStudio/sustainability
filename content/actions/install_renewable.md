# Opt for renewable electricity derived from natural sources, wherever possible

The source of electricity is always different, depending on the venue. It's not always in our control to ensure this is a renewable source, but inquiring is always a good starting point. From there on, we can take additional measures. 

If the venue does not use renewable energy, we can push for more reduction of our energy use. Additionally, the hosting of our digital services or remote access can always be done on [leaf.cloud](http://leaf.cloud) or another sustainable host, in order to minimise our depency on fossil fuels.
