# Keep track of the sustainable actions we took through documentation

In order to make our sustainability summary at the end of the project for reflection and learning, it's essential the choices we made in the project in terms of sustainability are documented. This is something the producer/creative lead of the project do together with the sustainability manager in a survey. Every action is described to then understand how this choice was made possible, or sometimes made impossible. 

This summary serves as a way for future project teams to learn from our previous actions, and how to best approach them so they are successful.
