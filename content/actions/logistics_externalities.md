# Keep track of, and minimise our externalities

Externalities are effects of our projects on third parties that were not involved in the processes. In short, unintended consequences. The natural world is most often affected by externalities as there is no adequate system in place to protect it. 

Sustainability involved internalising these externalities, for example charging more when a product affects a water supply so that the producer can use those funds to undo the damage or develop new techniques to not affect the water supply. 

In order to internalise (and thus minimise) our externalities, we need to keep track of them and make ourselves familiar with the effects of our operations on others. One way of doing this is studying the ecological impact of projects through an Impact reporting organisation.
