# Consider our material waste as a nutrient to another system

Enabling for reuse is one of the most sustainable actions we can take. In order to ensure that the materials at the end-of-life of our projects do not go to landfill, we can take measures to make them useful for others. This could be our clients using parts again in the future, or ourselves in a future project, or another party altogether. 

In order to keep materials and parts as useful as possible, you can use sustainable design methods like designing for modularity and dissassembly. 

It will require some additional logistics to actually have the materials end up in the next system, such as finding someone to take over the materials, and arranging for transport.
