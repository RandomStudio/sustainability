# Offset any unpreventable emissions through organisations

While our primary goal is emissions reduction, reaching that zero emissions target is a process that will take time. To bridge this gap, we always offset our projects' emissions through certified environmental organisations. 

To offset, we get an indication of our emissions through Impact Forecast, which is a streamlined Life Cycle Assessment tool. Then, we multiply this number by 10, to make sure we have covered everything, externalities included. We then select an organisation from our list of certified organisations, so we can be sure our donation will end up making a valuable contribution.
