# Prefer remote (video conference) meetings and presentations

One of our biggest studio emissions previously was air travel, so we want to limit this as much as possible to only the most essential trips. In place of a flight, ask yourself if the meeting can be a video conference. 

In 2020, due to the circumstances around Covid-19, we have learned that in most cases this is possible. Even when travel is possible again, remote meetings and presentations will still be our preference, as air travel causes such substantial emissions.
