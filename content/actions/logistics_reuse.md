# Integrate recycling and reuse in the project's life cycle

A lot of sustainable design methods mention the integration of reuse and recyling into the project's lifespan. This means setting aside resources to make these mechanisms truly part of our way of working. 

If we want to reuse our materials ourselves, we can think of leasing them to the client. This agreement has to be made early on in the process, for example as part of the contract or scope. We (or the client) will then have to arrange a return of these materials to our studio.

The client can also reuse materials if they see fit, this has to be agreed upon early on as well, otherwise we will have to think of another mechanism to ensure product stewardship. 

When we intend to recycle materials, we need to find a proper place to do this. Steel or other metals can be fairly easily recycled anywhere. Other materials such as foils or mixed material might be harder, if they end up in our 'rest' bin, it's mosly likely they will end up in landfill. An example for plastics: we can look for a company that is associated with Precious Plastics, where it can be reprocessed (upcycled) into new products.
