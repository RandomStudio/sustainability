# Take full Product Stewardship

A big part of the sustainability of a project lies within the end-of-life stage. Designing Product Stewardship into the project ensures that what happens to the material and equipment we have used, is our responsibility instead of the client. This better ensures proper processing of materials and leaves less loose ends. An example of product stewardship is leasing, or partnering with someone that uses our waste materials as their input. 

The greatest responsibility lies with whoever has the most ability to affect the full life cycle environmental impacts of the product. This is most often the producer of the project. 

It's also about taking full responsibility over our decisions throughout the project and the impacts of those. This also involves the design of the business model, for example good partnerships can really benefit product stewardships as well.
