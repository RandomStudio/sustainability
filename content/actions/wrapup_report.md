# Produce an external and internal sustainability summary

One of the best ways we can understand our impact and find out what we can do better next time around, is collecting all our decisions that led to a more, or less, sustainable project. If we have enough data, we can use a fast track Life Cycle Assessment to determine the ecological impact of our actions. However, without the data it's still valuable to make this summary for ourselves. 

We have based the actions in this toolkit on research and reports, even if we do not have the tools to accurately measure the ecological benefits, we can still be sure that they contribute to a more sustainable industry.

We share this summary with our teams internally to review it, as well as to the clients and production partners of that particular project. 

Our summaries are not impact reports, and we do not use the data we collect to make statements on how much CO2eq we saved.
