# Include the topic of sustainability in the end-of-project review

It's important to share our experience with incorporating sustainability into our projects. When sustainability is included in the end-of-project review, we can critically look at what went right and what could be improved. In which phase were sustainable actions more difficult, due to what reason? 

This time can be used to understand what factors contribute to the success of a sustainable action, and what could be changed the next time around to make it even better.
