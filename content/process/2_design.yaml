  - Apart from very few exceptions, most of our concepts will not be about sustainability itself but instead have other primary goals, e.g. emotion, spectacle and convention-breaking designs that attract and focus attention.
  - Nonetheless, when sustainability is considered at the earliest stages it becomes possible to guide the design away from unsustainable solutions that rely on heavy power usage, non-renewable/non-reusable materials or unnecessary long distance shipping.
