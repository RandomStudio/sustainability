description:
  - "Digital computation can seem abstract and ephemeral, but it does have a real-world impact. “Virtual” realities can only exist thanks to the extraction of very real materials, mass manufacturing, global supply chains and electrical energy production. Likewise, the “cloud” is constituted through infrastructure that is very much solid."
  - "Sustainable design thinking can be applied at a systems architecture level, such as carefully considering hosting options for large scale, “always available” online roll-outs. Next in order of importance is optimising both server-side and client-side processing to conserve computing resources."
