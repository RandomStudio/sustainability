  - Digital computation has a real-world impact that is obscured to most people. The power usage of both individual servers and data centres is directly dependent on how we task them and the design of the software that completes these tasks. Digital operations like queries, file transfers, image analysis and the use of AI all have a real, environmental footprint that quickly scales.
  - Sustainable design thinking can be applied at a systems-level, such as considering cloud hosting for large scale online roll-outs. Choosing hosting partners carefully is the first step, with optimising both server-side and client-side processing second, to allow for potentially very significant environmental impact reduction. This optimisation may range from more efficient algorithms that reduce the power consumption of servers to the background colour of websites that require less power to display.
  - When considering projects that entail a more physical build-out, simple steps such as implementing proper sleep & wake schedules for all computers and servers, more efficient idle modes and other software enhancements can make a significant impact in reducing the power consumption of these installations.
