description:
  - When building installations we should opt for materials that are made sustainably and that are appropriate for the lifecycle of the project.
  - Look for sustainable versions of go-to construction materials such as MDF and plywood. Even better, seek out innovative recycled materials, or materials made from unexpected resources, such as mycelium or surfaces made from coffee grinds. Wherever possible, keep an eye out for materials with a positive story to tell that is relevant to the project or the brand.
