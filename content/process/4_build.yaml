  - When building installations we should opt for materials that are made sustainably and that fit the lifecycle of the project. These materials range from sustainable versions of go-to construction materials like MDF and plywood to recycled, innovative or even storytelling materials made from unexpected resources, like mycelium or surfaces made from coffee grinds.
