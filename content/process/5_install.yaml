  - When working with a project that will be running elsewhere, the source of energy is often out of our hands. Finding ways to reduce energy usage is where we can make a real difference. For example opting for less energy intensive electronics (if available), using natural sources like sunlight, or having the project shut down whenever it’s not in use.
