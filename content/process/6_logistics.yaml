  - As a final measure, we can offer an offset model for environmental impact effected by the project that cannot be otherwise prevented or mitigated, such as flights. This should be seen as a last stopgap solution to any areas of the project that could not find a real sustainable solution, ie. electronics.
  - This offset can include contributions to the various certified organisations that we already work with, such as Carbonkiller, Rainforest Alliance, Trees For All, etc…
actions:
  - copy: Provide an accurate summary of mitigated emissions
  - copy: Establish a list of certified environmental organisations
  - copy: Keep track of unpreventable emissions like flights
