  - The most efficient travel option is not to travel at all. Meetings, presentations and even on-site setup can be done remotely, given the right tools and sufficient preparation. If travel is required, we should avoid the most carbon-intensive options (e.g. air travel) wherever possible.
  - 'Shipping of equipment and materials also needs to be considered. The “cheapest” option may have hidden costs if it requires transport over large distances.'
  - As a final measure, we can offer an offset model for environmental impact that cannot be otherwise prevented or mitigated, such as flights and shipping of manufactured products (e.g. electronics). This offset can include contributions to the various certified organisations that we already work with, such as Carbonkiller, Rainforest Alliance, Trees For All, etc.
