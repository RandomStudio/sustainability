  - We need to document and measure the steps and choices made with respect to sustainability throughout each project. This enables us to summarise what we have achieved in the form of a report.
  - The purpose of the report is to help our clients and ourselves to appreciate where we have made a positive difference, and identify areas where we can improve next time.
