        <p>If we can prove to decision makers how sustainable futures could look and feel like by prototyping* them, we can lower the perceived threshold for change, and ultimately bring about real systemic change to various industries.</p>
        <p>Random Studio aims to create work which connects people, and connects them to their environment. The studio consists of an international team of 30+ visual artists, designers, producers, creative technologists, producers and software engineers, enabling Random to control the entire design process from ideation to production and installation. It is this capacity; the ability to dream, design and build small pieces of the futureâ€” that positions the studio uniquely well, showing our clients what could be and encouraging them to take the next step.</p>
